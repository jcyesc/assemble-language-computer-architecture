Writting an Assembler

The aim of the project is to build a simple Assembler for SIM. This program doesn't have the total functionality of the
real Assembler but it intends to give a clear insight of how Assembler and Linker works.

This assembler takes the Specitication of the book:

Assembly Language And Computer Architecture Using C++ And Java
	Chapter Eleven: Implementing an Assembler and a Linker Using C++ or Java
