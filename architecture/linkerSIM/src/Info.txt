Linker SIM

This program links the programs, resolving external references and reallocating the new addresses.

It uses as examples m1.mas and m2.mas. If you use Anthony J. Dos Reis' software, the result of the link process is in
the file m1.mac. You can also see the tables generated by the program in the file m1.tab.
